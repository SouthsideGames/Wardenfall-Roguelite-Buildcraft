  - "There you are. Awake and still in one piece. That\u2019s already better than
    most starts."
  - "I\u2019m Aurelin. Your... assistant. Advisor. Babysitter. Depends on who you
    ask."
  - "You\u2019re on Carnifex now. It\u2019s not just a prison \u2014 it\u2019s the
    galaxy\u2019s favorite broadcast."
  - "Here\u2019s the deal. You want freedom? You have to earn it."
  - "And to earn it, you\u2019ll have to put on a show they can\u2019t stop watching."
  - "The Warden loves ratings. The crowd loves drama. They don\u2019t want you to
    just survive \u2014 they want you to do it with style."
  - "That\u2019s where you come in. You get to pick who enters the arena, choose
    their gear, plan their strategy. It\u2019s your show to run."
  - "Do it well, and you might just buy your freedom ticket. Mess it up, and\u2026
    well, let\u2019s not focus on that."
  - "So. Ready to get started? Let\u2019s choose your first contestant and give them
    a show they\u2019ll remember."
